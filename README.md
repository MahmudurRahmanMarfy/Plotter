# Hazardous Concentrations of Various Gases and Substances (ppm)

## LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas)
LEL: 18,000 ppm (1.8%)
UEL: 95,000 ppm (9.5%)
Normal Concentration in Environment: LPG is typically not found in the atmosphere in normal concentrations; it is usually confined to gas cylinders or pipes.
Hazardous Concentration: >10,000 ppm (suffocation risk, explosive risk)

## Hydrogen (H2)
LEL: 40,000 ppm (4%)
UEL: 750,000 ppm (75%)
Normal Concentration in Environment: 0.5 ppm
Hazardous Concentration: >1,000 ppm (dizziness, headache)

## Carbon Monoxide (CO)
OSHA PEL: 50 ppm (8-hour average)
Normal Concentration in Environment: ~0.1 ppm (varies with environmental factors).
Hazardous Concentration: 200 ppm (headaches, dizziness), 1,000 ppm (unconsciousness, life-threatening)

## Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
OSHA PEL: 5,000 ppm (8-hour average)
Normal Concentration in Environment: ~400-450 ppm in outdoor air.
Hazardous Concentration: 30,000-40,000 ppm (respiratory problems, dizziness), >50,000 ppm (suffocation)

## Alcohol (Ethanol)
Normal Concentration in Environment: Ethanol is not a common environmental contaminant unless in a specific setting (e.g., alcohol production or spills).

Hazardous Concentration: >1,000 ppm (dizziness, headache, respiratory irritation), >10,000 ppm (toxic, unconsciousness)

## Toluene
OSHA PEL: 100 ppm (8-hour average)
Normal Concentration in Environment: ~0.001 to 0.5 ppm in urban environments (varies with industrial activity)
Hazardous Concentration: 200 ppm (headaches, dizziness), >500 ppm (neurotoxic, high toxicity)

## Ammonia (NH3)
OSHA PEL: 25 ppm (8-hour average)
Normal Concentration in Environment: ~0.1-1 ppm in rural environments; higher concentrations near agricultural activities.
Hazardous Concentration: >50 ppm (eye, nose, throat irritation), >300 ppm (severe respiratory issues), >500 ppm (fatal)

## Acetone
OSHA PEL: 250 ppm (8-hour average)
Normal Concentration in Environment: ~0.3 ppm (in urban environments, typically from industrial activities).
Hazardous Concentration: >500 ppm (dizziness, headache, irritation), >1,000 ppm (toxic, CNS depression)
